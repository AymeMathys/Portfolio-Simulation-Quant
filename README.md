# Portfolio Simulation Quant

### Overview
This Python-based financial tool simulates the evolution of a portfolio balance over a specific investment horizon. It is designed to evaluate whether a monthly withdrawal strategy is sustainable or leads to capital depletion, while accounting for real-world banking costs.
My focus was to learn to correctly manipulate the loop "for"
### Key Features
* **Compound Interest:** Calculates monthly growth based on a 0.8% yield (~10% annually).
* **Management Fees:** Simulates a 1.2% annual fee applied to the current balance.
* **Bankruptcy Logic:** Automatically stops the simulation if the balance hits zero.
* **Comparative Analysis:** Provides a final report on total gains/losses and cumulative bank fees.

### Technical Details
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Concepts:** Modular arithmetic (for annual fees), Accumulators, and Financial modeling.

### How to Use
1. Run the script: `python portfolio_simulator.py`
2. Enter your **Starting Balance**.
3. Enter your **Monthly Withdrawal** goal.
4. Set your **Investment Horizon** (in months).
